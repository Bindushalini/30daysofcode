###About the project
**Code ATLEAST 3 programming questions a day**. This project is inspired from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/57hybf/i_sucked_at_algorithms_but_got_better_and_you_can) and a similar [initiative](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code). To quote from the reddit post.<br><br>
Most of us while preparing for Software Engineering Full-Time/Intern find it difficult to bring in a sense of continuity. Tracking the progress will give a feel of responsibility to our inner self.<br><br> 

###Rules

 - Fork this repository and commit in it your progress daily.
	 - Create an markdown file with username as the name of the file, for example sidgupta234.md in the coders folders.
	 - Copy paste the contents of [template.md file](https://github.com/sidgupta234/30daysofcode/blob/master/coders/template.md) to understand how you should format your progress.
	
 - Code(a genuine attempt) atleast 3 programming questions everyday, tagged with easy, medium and hard (suggestively in that order).
 - Tweet your progress every day using the #30DaysOfCode hashtag or [@30daysofcode](twitter.com/30daysofcode).
 - You can keep a blogroll at your own site or on medium to support further keep check on your progress.<br><br>


###FAQ 

**Why 30 days and not 20 or 50?**
Among peers we have noticed that it is difficult to have a goal that looks like a distant dream, we wanted to keep a realistic yet challenging target.

**What if I miss out a day?**
If you miss out a day, we'd encourage you to restart with the 30 day cycle. <br><br>
